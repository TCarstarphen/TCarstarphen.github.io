		<h2>Tips</h2>
		<h2 style="font-family:Rockwell;"
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<ul style="font-family:Rockwell;"
		<li>Keep your clothes tight (to prevent snagging)</li>
		<li>Duct tape it your friend! (Not only does it fix everything, but zombies can't bite through it)</li>
		<li>Know your exits (Map out the starcases, the front and back entries, and even if there's roof access)</li>
		<li>Have a partner! (You can't watch your own back)</li>
		<li>Pack light (you gotta be ready to go at a moments notice and you don't want to waste time packing)
		<li>Do. Not. Get. Bit.
		<li>Most importantly: AIM FOR THE HEAD</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Essentials</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disk">
		<ul style="color:red;"</ul>
		<li>Canned food (lasts longer than perishables, duh)</li>
		<li>Map of the area</li>
		<li>Flashlight</li>
		<li>Batteries</li>
		<li>Hand crank radio</li>
		<li>First aid kit</li>
		<li>Water bottle</li>
		<li>Matches</li>
		<li>Knife (for hunting and gathering, not killing)</li>
		<li>Cast iron skillet (multipurposeful, you can cook with it and use it to bash heads in)</li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<div class="cities"
		<h2>Things to Avoid</h2>
		<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li>Cities (Where there was once too many people, there will now be too many zombies)</li>
		<li>The radio (You can listen, but don't respond. Assume everyone is the enemy)</li>
		<li>Large groups (YOu can have a group of 3-4 people, but the larger the group, the louder you get)</li>
		<li>Noise. It attracts the zombies.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
